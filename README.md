# hello-world

In order to create a project that can be viewed using Expo in the terminal, you’ll need to install the Expo Command Line Interface (CLI) on your machine. The command is 'npm install expo-cli --global'. You also need to install the Expo app on your physical device and create an account.
Expo has its own SDK (software development kit—a set of development tools to create applications), which offers various features, like accessing the camera, retrieving geolocation, all of which can be viewed on you physical device or on a smartphone emulator.

Next, you create a new Expo project using the command 'expo init' followed by the name of the project. Terminal asks which template to use and you can select the blank one.
Once the project is created, go into the projects directory in terminal and run 'expo start'. The page will be shown on localhost and the option of using an emulator, a website, or a QR code for you external device, will be given.
